Make the Admin Uploader work end-to-end using Convex (no Supabase). Do all file edits yourself and show raw output for each command you run.

GOAL:
Admin Uploader uploads an image and creates a sticker row in Convex with a storageId. Then the UI lists the new sticker.

STEPS (DO IN ORDER):
	1.	Locate the Admin Uploader code:

	•	Search repo for the uploader entry UI and logic:
	•	grep -Rni “admin.*upload|uploader|Upload|upload” client/src convex | head -n 200
	•	Identify the main uploader component/page file path.

	2.	Remove any Supabase remnants in uploader flow:

	•	If uploader imports supabase client, storage bucket code, or env vars, replace with Convex calls.

	3.	Implement Convex upload flow (canonical):
A) Create/ensure these Convex functions exist:

	•	convex/uploads.ts (or similar):
	•	export const generateUploadUrl = action({ args: {}, handler: async (ctx) => await ctx.storage.generateUploadUrl() })
	•	convex/stickers.ts (or similar):
	•	export const finalizeStickerUpload = mutation({
args: {
storageId: v.string(),
name: v.string(),
categoryCode: v.optional(v.string()),
subcategoryCode: v.optional(v.string()),
// include any fields the UI needs
},
handler: async (ctx, args) => {
// insert row into stickers table with storageId + metadata
// return inserted id
}
})

B) Update Convex schema if needed:
	•	Add stickers table fields needed for uploader + listing.
	•	Add indexes if required.

	4.	Update frontend uploader:

	•	Call generateUploadUrl (Convex) to get a URL
	•	PUT the file to that URL (fetch)
	•	Receive storageId from the upload response
	•	Call finalizeStickerUpload with storageId + metadata
	•	Refresh list / navigate / show success

	5.	Provide a “smoke test” checklist:

	•	Start app
	•	Upload one PNG
	•	Confirm sticker appears in admin list
	•	Confirm sticker renders when listing reads from Convex

COMMANDS:
	•	Run npm test only if configured.
	•	Always run npx convex dev (or deploy if repo is pinned to prod) and show raw output.
	•	Show raw errors if any; fix them.

OUTPUT:
	•	List files changed
	•	Paste final function signatures for generateUploadUrl and finalizeStickerUpload
	•	Confirm Admin Uploader works end-to-end.
